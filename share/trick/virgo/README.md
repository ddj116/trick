# VIRGO

VIRGO: **V**ersatile **I**maging and **R**endering for **G**alactic **O**perations. A practical, analytical, and hardworking engineering visualization tool leveraging python-VTK.  Designed by and for engineers at NASA JSC (Johnson Space Center), VIRGO gives users insight into simulation data when typical 2D plots are insufficient. This project is developed specifically for engineers in the Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) division of the Engineering Directorate but aims to provide functionality for the [Trick](https://github.com.nasa/trick)-using community and beyond.

VIRGO intends to be an extensible, well-tested, and robustly documented python module which can consume simulation data in different ways. However, **VIRGO is currently in *alpha* status which means it has not yet been verified or validated in any way. Use caution when using VIRGO visualizations to draw conclusions about your engineering application. It is highly recommended that you cross-reference what you are seeing with other plotting or visualization tools before using a VIRGO scene to make an engineering decision.**

## A simple VIRGO example

The simplest data source supported is a typical `*.csv`  (comma-separated-value) text file containing a time history of object positions in 3D space. For example, imagine you had a file `log_state.csv` that describes the motion of a satellite in space and looks like this:

```csv
time (s),  position[0] (m),  position[1] (m),  position[2] (m),
     0.0,              0.0,              0.0,              0.0, 
     1.0,              5.0,              5.0,              5.0, 
     2.0,             10.0,             10.0,             10.0, 
     3.0,             20.0,             20.0,             20.0, 
     4.0,             30.0,             30.0,             30.0, 
```
The first line describes what the variables are and their `(units)`. All other lines provide monotonically increasing time values and position values at those times.  VIRGO can read this file and playback the position of the object described by the `position` array over the timeframe 0.0 - 4.0 seconds. In this example the x-position is `position[0]`, y-position is `position[1]`, and z-position is `position[2]` . In VIRGO terminology this file is considered a simple **data source**.

The **scene** defines what **actors** (the rendered objects) look like and links that object to a **data source**. VIRGO defines scenes using python dictionaries which are easily expressed as YAML files that look like this:

```yaml
# This section defines what objects (actors) are in the scene
# In this example there is only one actor named satellite
actors:
  satellite:           # User-defined name for this actor
    mesh: VIRGO_PREFAB:cube  # 3D representation of the object, a cube
    scale: 1.0         # The cube is 1 unit wide/tall/deep
    # This subsection defines what data source alias drives the actor
    driven_by:
      time: sim_time # Time is defined as sim_time: from section below
      pos: sat_pos   # Position is defined as sat_pos alias in section below

# This section defines what to read from a trickpy data source which is a data
# source supported by VIRGO specifically intended to read simulation data
# provided by https://github.com/nasa/trick simulation, but it also supports
# simple CSV files using the expected Trick format shown above
data_source:
  trickpy:
    sim_time:      # User-defined alias for simulation time
      group: state # 'state' comes from the filename: log_state.csv
      var: time    # The name for time (1st column 1st row of log_state.csv)
    sat_pos:       # User-defined alias for satellite x,y,z position values
      group: state       # 'state' comes from log_state.csv
      var: position[0-2] # Variables comprising sat_pos alias
```
This tiny example gives you a sense of what VIRGO can do. Any integer or floating point data can be consumed and used in VIRGO in various ways. 

## Features

Here are some things you can do with VIRGO:
1. Drive positions and orientations of **VIRGO actors** with respect to inertial space and/or relative to another actor. There is no limit to the number of actors in the scene beyond what your computer hardware can handle.
2. Use prefabricated meshes (cube, sphere, cylinder, etc.) to represent actors or provide your own mesh with `*.stl` or `*.obj` files
3. Visualize vectors that change over time in 3D space using **VIRGO vectors**
4. Display simulation data as text in the 3D scene using **labels**
5. Show where a **VIRGO actor** has been in world space by enabling **VIRGO trails**
6. Play, pause, and adjust playback speed
7. Step forward and backward through data while paused
8. Choose from multiple lighting modes including light from a sun positioned by simulation data

## Module Dependencies

This module requires python3.11 or later and the `pip` packages listed in `requirements.txt`. To pull down these packages to a standard python3.11+ virtual environment run the following in the directory you wish to create the `.venv`:
```bash
# Create a python3 virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate 
# Install virgo dependencies
pip3 install --upgrade pip && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Once the `.venv` is created, you can source the environment in any shell before running scripts using VIRGO:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
## Terminology

* **A VIRGO Scene** is a python dictionary (often expressed as a YAML file) that fully articulates the details of the 3D configuration that will be rendered and displayed to the user. This is the main method of configuration provided to the users of VIRGO and includes a list of `actors:`, `vectors:`, `frames:` as well as settings within the scene like lighting, data sources, labels, etc.
* **A VIRGO Interactive Window** is the result of running the VTK Renderer and Interactor loops. This is the primary display for the user showing everything provided in the **VIRGO Scene**. The interactive window responds to various keyboard and mouse inputs from the user. Press 'h' while the window is up for information on keyboard/mouse inputs.
* **VIRGO Actors** are 3D objects rendered in the scene and are defined by the `actors:` section of the scene dictionary. They can be positioned and oriented statically in the scene or driven by data sources.
  * **VIRGO Vectors** are **VIRGO Actors** that must be represented as an arrow in 3D space. Vectors are defined in the `vectors:` section of the scene dictionary and accept a position value which defines the tip of the vector to be drawn. 
  * **VIRGO Frames** are **VIRGO Actors** that have no mesh geometry. You can think of them as a reference frame positioned and oriented relative to some other reference frame or the world coordinates origin if the frame has no parent.
* **VIRGO Nodes** define the scene graph tree by managing **VIRGO Actors, Frames, and Vectors** as well as their position and orientation with respect to their parent or world coordinates if no parent is defined. Every actor, frame, and vector is automatically assigned and parented to a unique node of the same name. When objects move in a VIRGO scene it's because their underlying **VIRGO Node** is moving.  
* **Parents** allow nodes containing actors, frames, and vectors, to be defined relative to another actor, frame, or vector, by defining a `parent:` relationship. If a node has a parent that means all transformations on that node will be performed relative to that parent. Nodes and their parental relationships fully define one or more [directed acyclic graph trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)) which contain all the information needed to determine world position/orientation of any actor in the scene.
* **Root nodes** are nodes have no parents and therefore are positioned and oriented with respect to world coordinates (often considered inertial space)
* **Data Sources** provide engineering data associated with actors, frames, and vectors. Typically this amounts to variable values at specific simulation times, for example the position of a cube over a 10 second period.
* **Labels** allow the user to display text positionally within the 3D scene. Each **VIRGO Actor, Vector, and Frame** may optionally define `labels:` to render static text or information from a **data source** as the user sees fit.

## Data Playback

Details on the playback rate and showing data at a particular world time go here.

## Trails

Trails are lines drawn between world coordinate points occupied by actors as they are encountered by changing the world time in the interactive scene. They show you where an actor has been in the past (or future if playing backward) and are very useful for showing spacecraft orbits to end users.  Trails can be enabled/disabled with the `t` key and are completely reset when reaching the start/end boundary of simulation data associated with the scene.

It's important to note that because VIRGO doesn't necessarily render every time step associated with simulation data, the visible trail may not be displaying all spatial points between two positions. For example if simulation data is provided every 1.0 seconds, but the playback speed is set to 1000X while trails are enabled, many simulation data points will be skipped as the scene renders data points only at the simulation data encountered rendered frame to rendered frame.

## Camera

Currently VIRGO only supports a single camera view. The camera can be configured to follow `actors:` defined in the VIRGO scene (see the [`camera:` section of the YAML reference](#configure-scenes-with-a-yaml-file) below) and this is recommended for spacecraft simulations since stationary cameras provide little value when objects are moving at orbital velocities.

While using the interactive window the actor which is followed can be re-configured by right-click picking the actor and pressing the `c` key. To unfollow an actor, right-click pick empty space and press `c`.

## Lighting

While using the interactive window the lighting mode can be seen in the top-right part of the HUD. Lighting modes can be changed by pressing the `l` key - this will cycle between the supported lighting modes.

## Units

VIRGO (and the python-VTK code it's based upon) is unitless in nature which allows the user to work in any consistent units they find most useful.  For example, if you create a cube actor of size 10.0 positioned at (0,0,0) world coordinates, the cube has a width, height, and depth of 10.0 units.  It's on the user of VIRGO to decide what units are applicable and ensure all data entered into VIRGO is consistently represented in those units.

## The Heads Up Display (HUD)
Details TBD

## Headless Mode (render directly to video)

Details TBD

## Examples

Standalone examples can be found under the `examples/` directory.  See each directory's `README.md` for more detailed information.

* `satellite/` - A simple cube satellite in an equatorial orbit. This example shows how RCS jets firing can be visualized in a scene.
* `entry/` - A cube satellite entering earth atmosphere and landing in the ocean. This scene provides an example of how the VIRGO framework can be extended with custom functionality.
* `pendulums/` - A two-pendulum example demonstrating how VIRGO can consume data logged at multiple rates for each actor in a scene.
* `screensaver/` - A simple screensaver example which depicts the earth and moon as well as current time and weather. This provides another example of how VIRGO can be extended with custom functionality.

## Configure Scenes with a YAML file

[YAML](https://yaml.org/) provides a handy way to define python dictionaries and track them as code in a human-readable form. Note that YAML is not required to use VIRGO but you will need to provide VIRGO with a **scene dictionary** which fully defines the scene that will be rendered. The terms **scene**, **yaml file**, and **dictionary** may be used interchangeably in VIRGO documentation - ultimately they all refer to the same thing.

Here we provide a YAML file template which describes in immense detail the sections of the scene recognized by the VIRGO framework. Use this reference in combination with `examples/*/scene.yml` as a starting point for setting up your scene. If you are unfamiliar with python dictionaries and how YAML can represent nested data structures we recommend you go through [this YAML tutorial](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started) before reading further.

vectors:    # The dictionary which holds all vectors in the scene. A vector is
            #   an actor whose mesh is automatically set to an 3D arrow. The
            #   fields supported by vectors are identical to that of the actors:

                    #   relative to it's parent, or world coordinates if no
                    #   parent is specified. For example, if sat_pos represents

                    #   vector: with a driven_by: pos: sat_pos with no parent:
                    #   would draw a vector of length 1.0 in the direction of
                    #   the satellite's position, with the vector/arrow base
                    #   located at world coordinate origin. Tip: use scale: to

sun:          # The dictionary which holds information about the sun such
              #   as the direction it should be rendered in the scene
  direction:  # Optional list of 3 floats describing a unit vector [x,y,z]
              #   pointing towards the sun expressed in world coordinates
  driven_by:  # Optional actor, frame, or vector name that the sun's position
              #   is driven by in the scene. Suggest assigning this to
              #   a vector: that is configured to point at the sun via it's
              #   own driven_by: sub-dict

camera:       # The dictionary which holds information about the camera
  follow:     # Optional name of actor the camera should follow when the scene
              #   starts. If follow: given, it's value must be the key of a
              #   actor, vector, or frame defined in the scene
  near_clipping_plane_tolerance: # Optional float describing the VTK foreground
                                 # camera's # Near Clipping Plane Tolerance.

                                 # of # Z-fighting for far away actors. Defaults
                                 # to 0.00005 and can be adjusted with j/k in
                                 # the interactive window

picker:       # The dictionary which holds information about the picker
  tolerance:  # Optional float threshold for picking (right click) actors
              #   Defaults to 5e-7 and can be adjusted with J/K in the
              #   interactive window

It's worth noting that **in this VIRGO alpha release strict error checking on the fields described above is still a work-in-progress** so you should expect strange error messages if entering unexpected types in these dictionary fields.

Custom sections of the dictionary can be defined by users for any purpose they wish as long as they don't conflict with what VIRGO expects in the section above.
